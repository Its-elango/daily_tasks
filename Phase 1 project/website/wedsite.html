	<p>Although web design has a fairly recent history, it can be linked to other areas such as graphic design,
 user experience, and multimedia arts, but is more aptly seen from a technological standpoint. 
It has become a large part of people's everyday lives. It is hard to imagine the Internet without animated graphics, 
different styles of typography, background, videos and music. The web was announced on August 6, 1991; 
in November 1992, CERN was the first website to go live on the World Wide Web.
 During this period, websites were structured by using the <table> tag which created numbers on the website. 
Eventually, web designers were able to find their way around it to create more structures and format.
 In early history, the structure of the websites was fragile and hard to contain, so it became very difficult to use them.
 In November 1993, ALIWEB was the first ever search engine to be created (Archie Like Indexing for the WEB)</p>
