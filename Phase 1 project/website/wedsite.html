			imagine the Internet without animated graphics, different styles of typography, background,
			videos and music. The web was announced on August 6, 1991; in November 1992, CERN was the first 
			website to go live on the World Wide Web.During this period, websites were structured by using 
			the tag which created numbers on the website.Eventually, web designers were able to find their way
			around it to create more structures and format.In early history, the structure of the websites was 
			fragile and hard to contain, so it became very difficult to use them.In November 1993, ALIWEB was 
			the first ever search engine to be created (Archie Like Indexing for the WEB)
